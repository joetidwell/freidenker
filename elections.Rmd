## Some Editorial Comments...

<hr>

Like many other places, relatively few citizens choose to run for public office in Kendall County. While, unsurprisingly, well-salaried elected positions often have multiple people line up to run, those positions with nominal stipends (e.g. city council) or which are entirely unpaid (e.g. school board) often go uncontested, sometimes even when the candidate has never previously held office. My opinion is that this runs counter to the democratic principles that underpin our form of government and can make it difficult for our local institutions to be representative of our community. 

I believe some of the reasons that so few people run for local public office are:

- They don't understand the bureaucracy of the election process or think it's difficult to navigate (It's not)
- They think the positions they might be interested in would take a burdensome amount of time (Some do, most don't)
- They think it costs a ton of money to run (Some do, most don't)
- They think they're not qualified (Only qualification is to get the most votes)
- They think running a campaign is stressful and awkward (Well, unless you're a sociopath, this one is definitely true...)

This particular part of the website is my effort to try and help more people who want to run for office... actually do it.  I'm starting out by listing upcoming elections and providing the information someone would need to file for that office. Eventually, I'd like to add a "Campaigning 101" section that would help demystify what it takes to run a campaign.  I'm awkward, aggressive, and generally anti-social, yet I managed to get elected multiple times. If I can do it, anybody can.

<h2>Campaigning 101</h2>
<hr>


I will update this with detail later, but long story short....

- Figure out about how many votes you need
	- Given generally low voter turnout, some races (e.g. CoB City Council) may only have a few hundred people vote 
- Figure out who votes
	- You can get the data from the county elections office
	- Determine who you know, that regularly vote, and make sure to talk to them about why you're the best candidate
	- Determine who you know, that <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">do not</span> regularly vote, and make sure to talk to them about why they should
- Determine where the registered voters are... AND GO TALK TO THEM
	- This really is the most important part, and it costs nothing but your own effort and whoever might want to help you
		- Knock on doors
			- It's not fun, but it helps
			- BE RESPECTUL
				- Don't bother people who clearly don't want to talk (e.g. "No Solicitation" sign, closed gates, etc)
				- If someone wants to chat, chat but if they don't... GO AWAY
		- Have friends host "meet the candidate" events at their house
		- Participate in any forum and talk to any group that will have you
			- Tea party
			- Political Parties
			- Boerne Star
			- Rotary
			- etc...
	- My own opinion here, but it's a candidates obligation to make the case why they should be elected to the people. The people deserve to know, and it will help you get elected anyway.
