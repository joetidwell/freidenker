		<title>What Kinds of Taxes Does Comfort ISD Levy?</title>
		<answer>Like most all Texas public school districts, Comfort ISD's tax revenue comes solely through ad valorem tax levies based on a "property tax rate [that] consists of a maintenance and operations (M&amp;O) tax rate and ... an interest and sinking (I&amp;S) tax rate. The M&amp;O tax rate provides funds for maintenance and operations. The I&amp;S tax rate provides funds for payments on the debt that finances a district's facilities."^[“School District Property Values and Tax Rates.” Texas Education Agency, Texas Education Agency, 9 Aug. 2024, [tea.texas.gov/finance-and-grants/state-funding/additional-finance-resources/school-district-property-values-and-tax-rates](https://tea.texas.gov/finance-and-grants/state-funding/additional-finance-resources/school-district-property-values-and-tax-rates).] </answer>

					The Kendall Appraisal District (KCAD) is responsible for assessing property values and for "collecting local property taxes levied by Boerne ISD, Comfort ISD, the City of Boerne, Kendall County, Kendall County WCID #1, Kendall County MUD #1, Miralomas MUD and Cow Creek Ground Water Conservation District^[“Important Information about Your Tax Bill.” Kendall AD, [kendallad.org/important-information-about-your-tax-bill/](https://kendallad.org/important-information-about-your-tax-bill/). Accessed 31 Aug. 2024. ].

				<li>Homeowners' Tax Example:</li>
			</ul>

			The total tax rate is multiplied by every $100 of assessed taxable value for qualified properties within a district's boundaries. For example, if a homeowner's residence was valued by their tax appraisal district at $200,000 in a school district with a M&amp;O rate of 0.75 and a I&amp;S rate if 0.50 (total rate = 1.25), the annual property tax levied against their property would be $2,500. $$1.25 * \frac{200,000}{100} = $2,500$$]]></details>

    <title>How Has the Tax Burden for Boerne ISD's Homeowners Changed Over Time?</title>
    <answer><![CDATA[For a selected portfolio of real-estate (see details), from 2016-2024 the real (i.e. inflation adjusted) tax burden increased an average (median) of {{{JWT_TAX_MEDIAN}}} with an increase of {{{JWT_TAX_LOW}}} as the smallest change and {{{JWT_TAX_HIGH}}} as the largest.]]></answer>
    <details>Many factors influence the average tax burden for homeowners beyond the tax rate, including the type of home people choose to purchase (size, quality, location, etc) and in particular changes in appraisal values which do not necessarily track inflation. While an "apples to apples" comparison across the district is not possible given the limited data publically available (i.e. free), I analyzed the change in tax burden from 2016-2024 (all years data that is available from the Kendall County Appraisal District Property Search website^[“Kendall Ad Property Search.” Kendall AD Property Search, [esearch.kendallad.org](https://esearch.kendallad.org). Accessed 17 Sept. 2024. ]) for the five properties I or my parents owned at some point since 1985. These properties include four residences within the City of Boerne and one rural property in Kendall County.</details>
